# Why Donate to the BRCA Exchange?
## Every $1 helps TWO patients access better data.

Genetic tests for _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ have more than doubled in the past five years.(1) With more tests being administered every year, accessible, high quality data is of the utmost importance. 

The BRCA Exchange makes high quality data available to the international public. This free-of-charge resource allows researchers, testing companies, and clinicians access a consistent, shared data set regardless of where or how the test is done. BRCA Exchange data is checked by experts in the field, so clinicians can be confident that they are accessing the best information possible when helping patients. Monthly data releases, alongside expertly designed collection methods, also provide clinicians with updated, complete public information on each variant in the BRCA Exchange. 

Oftentimes, genetic tests give unclear results. Every new resource offered by the BRCA Exchange provides more clarity for _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ tests. The benefits of having clear, reliable, free BRCA information available to all are two-fold: 

* The BRCA Exchange helps patients with dangerous mutations get the information they need, sooner and more reliably.  
* The BRCA Exchange helps people with definitively benign genetic variation know that their inherited risk is low, which helps patients avoid unnecessary mastectomies or oophorectomies. 

Our summary-level information safeguards patient privacy.(2) Our commitment to open source ensures that any clinical team has access to our data, so that patients are aided by our data regardless of how they access care. 

This year, the BRCA Exchange is working to improve the quality of data on over 5,000 genetic variants. This work could benefit as many as 968,000 individuals worldwide. Given the costs required to maintain and improve the BRCA Exchange, we estimate that every $1 donated could help 2 patients access better BRCA data.(3)
