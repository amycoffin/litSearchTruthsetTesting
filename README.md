# litSearchTruthsetTesting
There are 2 truth set files (one for BRCA1, one for BRCA2) that contain LOVD literature data. A 3rd file, labeled exampleLitSearchOutput can be used as an argument for the main module, litSearchVsTruthSet, to test LitSearch output against the truthset. Output: a pubs dictionary (in its own .py file) and performance stats (printed in terminal).
